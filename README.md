# Mouse-Control-System-Using-Hand-Gestures

 Gesture is performed by the user according to the function he needs to be performed in System. By using these model users can control the mouse with gestures performed by user Infront of web camera.
So, purpose of the model is to interact with machines like computers without any sensors or microprocessors, to control the mouse functions and give the information that is required to perform the function. We make use of the in-built camera or webcam to capture the gestures performed by the user as input and perform the corresponding functions given to the system. We capture the real time feed from the camera, convert the video into a number of image frames to process them, extract different parameters from the image and finally perform the respective mouse operations according to detected gestures.
